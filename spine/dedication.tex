This thesis is dedicated to my mentor and father Klaus Rosskothen. I am sure you watch all my steps closely and i hope that i can make you proud in all the decisions and steps that i took and the ones that lay ahead of me. You were and always will be my biggest motivational driver. Rest in peace dad.
